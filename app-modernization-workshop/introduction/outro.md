# Proceeding through the workshop

This workshop will be broken down to introduce a particular topic or pattern. Each will then be reinforced by exercises.

The code used in this course will be based on Java and Spring Boot. As one proceeds through the course exercises code patterns will be introduced to and will required refactoring a codebase to implement the pattern. The fictional Piv-Mart monolith application will be introduced later.

Please feel free to jump around, but keep in mind each pattern will be intended to flow like the following:

* Introduce a topic or pattern, such as Discovery
* Implement a topic or pattern that is agnostic of any cloud environment
  * This allows one to develop freely in a local development environment
* Implement a topic in a specific cloud environment
  * The intended target environments will be:
    * Kubernetes
    * VMWare Tanzu Application Service or TAS
